            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
           
            <p>The Petrol Sales and Stock Control System aims to streamline and automate the management of petrol sales and stock control processes for a petrol station. The system will provide real-time information about fuel inventory levels, facilitate smooth sales transactions, generate reports, and improve overall efficiency and accuracy.
The primary objective of this project is to streamline the process of petrol sales and stock management, eliminating manual tasks and minimizing human errors. The system will incorporate features like real time tracking of fuel sales, automated inventory management, integration with fuel tank and dispensers, and reporting functionalities for business analysis. 
<h3><b>	Statement of the problem</u</b</h3>
<h4><b>2.1	Description of the existing system </u</b</h4>
<p>Before the introduction of the new petrol sales and stock control system, petrol stations typically relied on manual processes and traditional methods for managing sales and inventory. This manual system posed several challenges and limitations, which the new system aims to address. 

In the existing system, petrol sales were recorded manually using pen and paper or simple electronic cash registers. This manual process resulted in slower transaction times and increased the chances of errors in recording sales, calculating prices, and generating invoices. It also made it difficult to track individual customer purchases and maintain accurate sales records.

Inventory management in the existing system was typically done through manual stocktaking and reconciliation, which involved physically measuring the fuel levels in the tanks and comparing them against theoretical values. This manual process was time-consuming, prone to errors, and did not provide real-time visibility into stock levels. It often led to situations where fuel shortages occurred, impacting customer service and potentially resulting in lost sales.

Furthermore, the existing system lacked integration with fuel tanks and dispensers, which meant that fuel sales were not automatically deducted from the stock levels. This lack of integration made it susceptible to discrepancies between recorded sales and actual fuel levels, making it difficult to accurately track stock movement and consumption.

Reporting and analysis in the existing system were also limited. Generating reports required manual compilation and calculation of data, making it a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This hindered the ability to make informed business decisions based on real-time information about sales trends, stock levels, and profitability analysis.

Overall, the existing system for petrol sales and stock control was largely manual, inefficient, and prone to errors. The introduction of the new system aims to automate and streamline these processes, providing a more accurate, efficient, and integrated solution for managing petrol sales and stock control.
